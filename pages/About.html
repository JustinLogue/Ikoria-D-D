    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What is this site?</h3>
    <p>This site is a homebrew resource to use in Dungeons and Dragons. It's about world of Ikoria from Wizard's other geek product: Magic the gathering. 
    Please note that this is all homebrew and under tested content.</p>
    <h3>What is Ikoria?</h3>
    <p>Ikoria is a world or plane in the Magic the Gathering. I beleive it would make great combat oritented D&D setting for it's fanatasy ecology. 
    The world is divided into five triomes, bizzare enivroments where three differnet types of land mass overlap one anthoer. Thorought outthese triomes are magic crystals and
    huge monsters of brizzare speice amalgams, made even werid by their abitly to spontaously mutate into werid, larger ones when in the prescents of the crytals.</p>
    <h3>What does this website have</h3>
    <p>An incomplete about and bestiary page... for now.</p>
    <h3>What will it have?</h3>
    <p>The monsters in the bestiary is currently being writen, search functionality with be after that. Then subclasses are next. I tend to do CSS styling last (having the info on screen is key to ).</p>
