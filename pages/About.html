    <h3>What is Ikoria?</h3>
    <p>Ikoria is a world or plane in the Magic the Gathering. I beleive it would make great combat oritented D&D setting for it's fanatasy ecology. 
    The world is divided into five triomes, bizzare enivroments where three differnet types of land mass overlap one anthoer. Thorought outthese triomes are magic crystals and
    huge monsters of brizzare speice amalgams, made even werid by their abitly to spontaously mutate into werid, larger ones when in the prescents of the crytals.</p>
